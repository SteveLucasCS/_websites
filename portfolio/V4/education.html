          <p>At Grand Valley's cutting-edge campus, I have had the opportunity to learn the basics of Java and Web Developement so far,
          as well as growing as a person thanks to the diverse array of general education classes. In the coming semesters, I will
          learn about 3D design, information assurance, database structures and algorithms, and many other skills vital to the IT
          professional and full-stack developer.</p>

          <p>I started my college journey at Lake Superior State University, a campus at the last exit before the International Bridge to Canada.
          I entered my freshman year with the plan of graduating in three years with a B.A in Homeland Security, with the goal of helping
          people as a police officer, and hopefully an eventual federal agent. I gained vital experience in the law enforcement field,
          including an internship with the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Chicago, the second largest department in the country, and a year of working
          as a Public Safety officer for my university. After these two years however, it was clear to me that it wasn't the right field for me.
          I craved mental stimulation; an outlet for my creativity and a career that involved problem solving on a daily basis.<br><br>
          I then decided to change my field of study to Mechanical Engineering. I found great satisfaction in making things, and loved
          the challenging nature of the courses. In this year of my studies, I learned manufacturing processes, CAD basics, and the
          basics of materials science. Then, crucially, I took a 'C' Programming course required for engineering, and found I absolutely loved
          programming. It was a way to make whatever you can imagine from scratch; the perfect test of my creativity, and a field
          on the frontlines of solving the problems of today and tomorrow. After I found this love for programming, I made the decision to
          change my major to Compuer Science, and transfer to Grand Valley State University, an profoundly esteemed institution closer to home.</p>
