        <h1>My Skills and Technologies</h1>
        <section>
          <p class="tablet">I have a truely unique and broad set of skills and experience in several fields. This range shows my adaptability, and eagerness and aptitude to
          learn continuously and improve myself. I am a highly logical and analytical person, leading to a very 'scientific' world view. I am always curious
          about the world around, especially how things work. This lead me to world of engineering and computer science, where I can exercise my creativity
          and problem solving skills every day.</p> <!-- shown on desktop only -->
          <p>As a computer science professional with an understanding of engineering, manufacturing, security,
          and modern business, I always see the big picture and seek to understand the world around me. While a list of technical skills may be necessary
          for a job, my desire for self-growth and learning will be my most important asset in my career.</p>

        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <section class="tablet">
          <p>My primary focus is software engineering. I have the most experience with <span>C</span>, <span>Java</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>.
          I am comfortable with <span>Python</span> and have some experience using it for <span>machine learning</span> programs. I am currently learning how to develop mobile
          apps in my spare time.<br>
          Most of my programming experience is with <span>Java</span>, writing desktop applications. The ease of use of Java allows me to get work done quickly,
          and its versatility means it can be used for most applications.
          <br>I use <span>JavaScript</span> for web applications or simple scripts, as well as any desktop application where it is more efficient than Java.
          <br>I have also used <span>Python</span> for <span>machine learning</span>, particularly <span>neural network</span>, programs, such as an AI for Super-Tic-Tac-Toe. While not a complicated
          program, it demonstrates that I have an understanding of how neural nets work, and is a door to the countless applications for machine learning technology.
          <br>My experience with <span>C</span> allows me to write low-level programs that interact closely with the operating system and hardware. C may be the
          best option when a progam has to be well optimized and efficient, and as infrequent as these niche cases may be, it is an important
          skill to have.

        <section class="tablet">
          <p>I have a unique combination of experience with network and system administration, information assurance, law enforcement, homeland security, and
          infrastructure protection.<br>My knowledge of network administration includes; setting up networks, monitoring traffic, managing permissions,
          and troubleshooting and solving software, network, and hardware problems.<br>My homeland security and law enforcement experience has taught me
          threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, infrastructure protection, physical security, and personel security policies.<br>This gives me an edge
          in my prospective field of information security, where I also have knowledge and experience around cyber security. Though I have limited experience
          with penetration testing myself, I understand the tools, methods, and logic of hacking and cracking. I can identify network and system vulnerabilities,
          and am sure to always make any code I write as secure as possible.</p>

        <h2>Business</h2>
        <section class="tablet">
          <p>I have seen both the corporate world and small business entrepreneurship, and my first-hand immersion has taught me much more than any class ever could.
          I've witnessed great leaders, proper communication, and efficient practices that I seek to emulate in myself. I believe my work ethic, growth mindset,
          and empathy are my personal strengths, and it is evident in the work I do; always striving for perfection and pushing my limits.<br>
          I can use all Microsoft Office programs to their full potential, as well as experience with Photoshop and 3D modeling and CAD software. I have a lot of
          experience with Salesforce as an administrator, including developing new tools with the Salesforce sandbox and their API. I also took time to understand
          the user experience and how spoke with sales personel to understand how I could make tools that were efficient and right for them.<br>
          My knowledge of SQL has saved me many hours, and likely prevented many errors, compared to using MS Excel. I have a valuable experience working with
          proprietary databases and software, as well as a multitude of APIs.<br>My business acumen seperates me from other's in the computer science industry,
          along with a passion for studying economics.</p>

        <h2>Manufacturing Engineering</h2>
        <section class="tablet">
          <p>I have experience with the mechanical design side of engineering, as well as the manufacturing processes aspect.<br>
          For CAD, I have used Creo Pro-Engineer 3 extensively. I also have limited experience with MATLAB and materials science.<br>
          My education in manufacturing engineering taught me how to use nearly every tool in a machine shop, and opened my eyes
          to true complexity and precision of manufacturing. From casting a plaque to making a threaded bolt, I learned how to
          <span>weld, cast, mold, CNC, thread, and cut material</span>. I am comfortable with a <span>laithe, drill press, band saw, belt machines,
            oxy acetylene tools, plasma cutters, and more.</span><br>
          Not only did I enjoy this class endlessly, but it also gave me a greater appreciation for what goes on on a plant floor or
          in a machine shop, and that makes me a great fit in a manufacturing industry.</p>
