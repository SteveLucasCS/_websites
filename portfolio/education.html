                <h2>Grand Valley State University --- 2018 - 2020 (Expected)</h2>
                <h3>Computer Science - Bachelors of Science Degree</h3>
                <p>At Grand Valley's cutting-edge campus, I have had the opportunity to learn the basics of Java and Web Developement so far,
                    as well as growing as a person thanks to the diverse array of general education classes. In the coming semesters, I will
                    learn about 3D design, information assurance, database structures and algorithms, and many other skills vital to the IT
                    professional and full-stack developer.</p>

                <h2>Lake Superior State University --- 2014 - 2017</h2>
                <h3>Mechanical Engineering --- 2016 - 2017<br>
                    Homeland Security --- 2014 - 2016</h3>
                <p>I started my college journey at Lake Superior State University, a campus at the last exit before the International Bridge to Canada.
                    I entered my freshman year with the plan of graduating in three years with a B.A in Homeland Security, with the goal of helping
                    people as a police officer, and hopefully an eventual federal agent. I gained vital experience in the law enforcement field,
                    including an internship with the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Chicago, the second largest department in the country, and a year of working
                    as a Public Safety officer for my university. After these two years however, it was clear to me that it wasn't the right field for me.
                    I craved mental stimulation; an outlet for my creativity and a career that involved problem solving on a daily basis.<br>
                    I then decided to change my field of study to Mechanical Engineering. I found great satisfaction in making things, and loved
                    the challenging nature of the courses. In this year of my studies, I learned manufacturing processes, CAD basics, and the
                    basics of materials science. Then, crucially, I took a 'C' Programming course required for engineering, and found I absolutely loved
                    programming. It was a way to make whatever you can imagine from scratch; the perfect test of my creativity, and a field
                    on the frontlines of solving the problems of today and tomorrow. After I found this love for programming, I made the decision to
                    chagne my major to Compuer Science, and transfer to Grand Valley State University, an profoundly esteemed institution closer to home.</p>
